## About Project

Our idea was to create voice assistant similar to Google assistant but for desktop devices and in polish language. We decided that assistant will have the following features:

+ [telling jokes](###telling-jokes)
+ [finding curiosities](###finding-curiosities)
+ [playing YouTube videos](###playing-YouTube-videos)
+ [searching phrase in both Wikipedia and Google](###searching-phrase-in-both-Wikipedia-and-Google)
+ [checking current Covid-19 data](###checking-current-Covid-19-data)
+ [planning events](###planning-events)
+ [sending and receiving messages with other users](###sending-and-receiving-messages-with-other-users)
+ [planning tasks](###planning-tasks)
+ [changing volume](###changing-volume)
+ [checking current weather](###checking-current-weather)
+ [changing brightness of the screen](###changing-brightness-of-the-screen)

During implementation we used many libraries and frameworks, for instance:

+ Django REST Framework to implement dedicated server
+ Selenium for automating web browsers
+ Google speech recognition
+ Tkinter for creating graphical user interface

While working on the project we learned how to properly configure python virtual environment, so we could use it easily with operating systems both Ubuntu and Windows. New experience for us was to create REST API server using Django framework. We've had experience with REST API architecture before, but in different programming languages, so it was our first time with Django. We have also learned a lot about group cooperation, and sharing responsibilities.
